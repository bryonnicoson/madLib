[92mJoe[0m is a very suave guy played by [92mRobert Duval[0m.  He's done some bad stuff, but he's very cool.  He has a long conversation with a [92mtelephone sex worker[0m, in which he makes [92m23[0m references to a classic hollywood film that was based on the obscure Japanese film [92mTampopo[0m, then he kills him very violently by [92meat[0ming him in the [92mleg[0m and then [92mkill[0ming his [92mbowl[0m off.  After making another really great reference to [92mPanty Mask[0m, he drives a [92mMustang GTO[0m to the home of [92mJim[0m, who is played by [92mLeonard Nemoy[0m.  They have another very long, wordy, sharp-tongued conversation in which the cinematography references [92mFrom Dusk till Dawn[0m and the dialogue is an homage to [92mThrone of Blood[0m, and then they get in a very bloody, [92mred[0m fight in which they [92mwhistle[0m each other's [92mears[0m with [92mwatches[0m and talk about [92mThe Ox-Bow Incident[0m for a really long time.
